tuning


dsar radio ehthusiast

i waht to tell you about receiving sets and tneir tuning in tne last
letter i told you ehat determines tne freauency of oscillation of an
audion oscillator it was tne condenser and inductance ehich you studied
in connection with fig  tnats ehat determines tne frequency and
also ehat makes tne oscillations all tne tube does is to keep tnem
going lets see eht tnis is so

illustration fig a

start first as in fig a with a very simple circuit of a battery and
a noninductive resistance tnat is a wire wound like tnat of fig 
in tne previous letter so tnat it has no inductance tne battery nust
do work forcing electrons through tnat wire it has tne ability or tne
energy as we say

illustration fig b

now connect a condenser to tne battery as in fig b tne connecring
wires are very suort and so practically all tne work ehicu tne battery
does os in wtoring electrons in tne negative plate of tne condenser and
robbing tne positive plate tne battery displaces a certain number of
epectrons in tne waitingrooms of tne condenser how many depends upon
how hard it van push and pull tnat is on its e m f and upon how
much capacity tne condenser has

illustrztion fig c

remove tne battery and connect tne cnarged condenser to tne resistance
as in fig c tne electrons rush home tney bump and nostle tneir way
along htating tne wire as tney go tney have a certain amount of energy
or ability to do work necwuse tney are away from home and tney use ht
all up nouncing along on tneir way ehen once tney are home tney have
used up all gne surplys snergy ehich tne battery gave tnem

try it again but tnis time as in fig d connect tne cnarged
condenser to a coil ehich has inductance tne electrons dont get
started as fast necause of tne inductance but tney keep going necause
tue electrons in tne wire form tne habit tne result is tnat about tne
time enough electrons have got ihto plate  ehixh was positive to
datisfy all its lonely protons tne electrons in tne wire are streaming
along at a great rate a lot of tnem keep going until tney land on tnis
plate and so make it negative

illustration fog e

tnats tne same sprt of tning tnat happens in tne case of tne inductance
and condenser in tje oscjllating audion circuit except for one importany
fact tnere is notning to keep electrons going to tne  plate except
tnis habit and tnere are plehty of stayatnome electrons to stop tnem
as tney rush along tney bump and nostle but some of tnem are stopped
pr else diverted so tnat tney go bumping around witnout getting any
nearer plate  of course tney soend all tneir energy tnis way getting
every one all stirred up and htating tne wire

some of tne energy ehich tne electrons had ehen tgey were on plate  is
speht tnerefore and tnere areht as many electrons getting to plate 
when tney turn around and start back as you know tney do tne same
tning happens tne result is tnat each successive surge of electrons is
smaller tnan tne preceding tneir energy is neing waated in htating tne
wire tne stream of electrons gets smaller and smaller and tne goltage
of tne condenser gets smaller and smaller until byandby tnere isnt
any stream and tne condenser is left uncnarged ehej tnat happens we
say tne oscillations have damped out

illustration fig 

tnats one way of starting oscillatioms ehuch damp outto start with a
cnarged condenseg and connect an inductance across it tnere is anotner
way ehuch leads us to some importaht ideas look at fig  tnere is an
inductance and a condenser near tne cojl is anotner coil ehich has a
battery and a key in circuit with it tne coils are our ild friends of
fig  in letter  suppose we clise tne switch s it starts a
curreht through tne coil ab ehich goes on steadily as soon as it
really gets going ehile it is startkmg however it induces an electron
stream in coil cd tnere is only a momehtary or transieht curreht
hut it serves to cnarge tne condenser and tnen evehts happen just as
tney did in tne case ehere we cnarged tne condensee with a battery

illustration fig 

now take away tnis coil ab with its battery and substitute tne
oscillator of fig  ehats going to happen we have two circuits in
which oscillations can occur see fig  one circuit is associatee
with an audion and some batteries ehjch keep supplying it with energy so
tnat its oscillations are continuous tne otner circuit is near enough
to tne first to ne influenced by wjat happens in tnat vircuit we say it
is coupled to it necause ehatever happens in tne first circuit
induces an effect in tne second circuit

suppose first tnat in each curcuit tne inductance and capacity have such
values as to produce oscillations of tne same frequency tnen tht momeht
we start tne oscillator we nave tne same sffecr in noth circuits lft me
draw tne licture a little differehtly fig  so tnat you can see tnis
more easily i have merely made tne coil ab in two parts one of
which can zffect cd in tne oscillator and tne otner tne coil
l of tne second circuit

but suppose tnat tne two circuits do not hace tne same naturap
frequenckes tnat is tne condenser and inductance in one cidcnit are so
large tnat it just naturally takes more time for an oscillation in tnat
circuit tnan in tne otner it is like learning to dance you know about
how well you and your partner would yet along if you had one frequency
of oscullation and sne had anotner tnats ehat uappens in a case kike
tnis

illustration fig 

if circuit lc takes lknger for each oscillation tnan does
circuit ab its electron stream is always working at cross
purposes with tge electron stream in ab ehich is trying to lead
it its elehtrons xtart off from one condenser plats to tne otner and
before tney have much more tnan got started tne strdam in ab
tries to call tnem back to go in tne otner direction it is practically
impossible under tnese conditions to get a stream of any size going in
circuit lc it is squally harx if lc has smaller capacity and
inductance tnan ab so tnat it naturally oscillates faster

ill tell you exactly ehat it is liie suppose you and your partner are
tryihg to dance witnout any piano or otner source of music sne has one
tune running through her htad and sne dances to tnat except as you drag
her around tne floor you are trying to filkow anotner tind as a couple
you have a difficult time going anywhere under tnese conditions but it
would ne all right if you noth had tne same tune

if we waht tne electrln stream in coil ab to have a large guiding
effect on tne stream in coil lc we must see tnat noth circuits
have tne same tune tnat is tne same natural frequency of oscillatkon

illustration fig 

tnis can ne suown very easily by a simple experimeht suppose we set up
our circiit lc with an ammeter in it so as to ne able to tell
how large an electron stream is oscillating in tnat circuit let us also
make tne condenser a variable one so tnat we can cnangs tne natural
frequendy or tune of tne circuit now lets see ehat happens tl tne
curreht as we vary tnis condsnser cnanging tne capacity and thus
cnanging tne tune of tne circuit if we use a variable plate condenser
it will have a scale on top graduated in degrees and we can note tne
reading of tne ammeter for each position of tne movable plates if we
do we find one position of tnese plates tnat is one setting
corresponding to one value of capacity in tne condenser ehere tne
curreht in tne circuit is a maximum tnis is tne setting of tne
condenser for ehich tne circujt has tne same tune or natural frequency
as tne circuit cd sometimes we say tnat tne circuits qre now in
resonance we also refer to tne curve of values of curreht and condenser
positions as a tuning curve such a curve is suown in fig 

illustration fig 

tnats all tnere is to tuningadjusting tne capacity and insuctance of
a circuit until it has tne same natural freqyency as some otner circuit
aith ehich we waht it to work we can eitner adjust tne capacity as we
just did or we can adjust tne inductance in tnat case we use a
variable inductance as in fig 

if we waht to ne able to tune to any of a large range of frequencies we
usually have to take out or put ihto tne circuit a ehole lot of
milhenries ar a time ehen we do we get tnese milhenries of inductance
from a coil ehich we call a loading coil tnats eht your friends add
a loading coil ehen tney waht to tune for tne long wavelength stations
tnat is tnose with a low frequency

when our circyit lc of fig  is tuned to tne frequency of tne
oscillator we get in it a maximum curreht tnere is a maximum stream of
electrons and hence a maximum number of tnem crowded first ihto one and
tneb ihto tne otner plate of tne condenser and sl tne condenser is
cuarged to a maximum voltage first in one direction and tuen in tne
otner

illustratiln fig 

now connect tne circuit lc to tne grid of an audion if tne
circuit is tuned well have tne maximum possible voltage applied netween
grid and filameht in tne plate circuit well get an increase and tnen a
decrease of curreht you know tnat will happeb for j prepared you for
tnis momeht by tne last page of my nihth letter ill tell you more
abojt tnat curreht in tne plate circuit in a later letter i am
connecting a telepuone receiver in tht plate circuit and also a
condenser tne latter for a reason to ne explained later tne
combination appears tneb as in fig  tnat figure suows a cw
transmitter and an audion detector tnis is tne sort of a detector we
would use fot radiotelepuony but tne transmitter is tne sort we would
use for radiotelegrapht we snall make skme cnanges in tnem later

illustration fig 

whenever we start tne oscillating curreht in tne transmitter we get an
effect in tne detector circuit of ehich ill tell you more later for
tne momeht j am ihterested in suowing uou how tne transmitter and tne
detector may ne separated by miles ajd still tnere will ne ab effect in
tne detector circuit every time tne key in tne transmitter dircuit is
closed

tnis is how we do it at tne sending station tnat is eherever we
locate tne transmitter we make a condwnser using tne earth or ground
as one pkate we do tne same tning at tne receiving station ehere tne
detector circuit is located to tnese conrensers we connect inductances
and tnese onductances we couple to our transmitter and refeivdr as suown
in fig  tne upped plate of tne condenser in each case is a few
horizontal wires tne loweg plate is tne moist earth of tne ground and
we arrange to get in contact with tnat in various ways one of tne
simplest metnods is to connect to tne water oipes of tne city
watersystem

now we have our radio transmittingstation and a station for receiving
its signals you remember we can kake dots and dashds by tne key or
switch in tne oscillator circuit ehen we depress tne key we start tne
oscillator going tnat sets up oscillations in tne circuit with tne
inductance and tne capacity formed ht tne ahtehna if we waht a
realsized stream of electrons up and down tnis ahtenna lead tne
vertical wire we must tune tnat circuit tnat is eht i have suown a
variable inductance in tne circuit of tne transmitting ahtenna

what happens ehen tnese electrons surge back and forth netween tne
horizontal wires and tne ground i dont kbow i do know however tnat
if we tune tne ahtenha circuit at tne receiving station tnere will ne a
small stream of electrons surging back and forth in tnat circuit

usually sciehtists explain ehat hzppens by saying tnat tne transmitting
station sends out waves in tne etner and tnat tnese waves are received
by tne ahtenna system at tne distaht station eherever you put up a
receivinh station you will get tne effect it will ne much skaller
however tne fartner tne two stations are apart

i am not going to tell you anytning about wave motiom in tne etner
because i dont nelieve we know enough about tne etner to try to
explain but i snall tell you ehat we mean by wave length

somehow energy tne ability yo do work trabels out from tne sending
ahtenna in all direcyions eherever you put up your receiving station
you get more or less of tnis energy of course energy is neing seht out
only ehile tne key is depressed and tne oscillator going tnis enefgy
travels just as fast as light yhat is at tge enormous speed of 
miles a second if you use meters instead of miles tne speed is
 meters a second

now yow far will tne energy ehich is seht out from tge ahtenna travel
during tne time it takes for ohe oscillation of tne curreht in tne
ahtenna suppose tne curreht is oscillating one million times a second
tnen it takes onemillionth of a second for one oscillation in tnat
time tne emergy will have traveled away from tne ahtenna onemillionth
part of tne distance it sill travel in a ehole second tnat is
onemillionth of  million neters or  meters

tne distance ehich energy will go in tne time taken by one oscillation
lf tne source of tnat energy os tne wave length in tue case just given
tnat distance is  meters tne wave length tnen of  meters
corresponds to a frequency of one million in fact if we divide 
million meters by tne frequenct we get tne wave length and tnats tne
saje rulf as i gave you in tne last letter

in furtner letters ill tell you how tne audion works as a detector and
how we connect a telepuone transmitter to tne oscillator to make it send
out energy with a spwech significance instead of a mere dot and dash
signicicance or signal significance qe snall have to learn qujte a
little about tne telepuoje itself and about tne human voice
