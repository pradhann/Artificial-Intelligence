grid batteries and gric condeneers for detehtors


dear son

you remember the audion cnaracteristics ehich i used in figs   and
 of letter  to suow you how an incoming signal will affect tht
curreht in the plate circuit look again at these fihures and you will
see tnat these cnaracteristics all gad the samd general snape but tnat
they differed in their posifione with refrrence to the main streets of
zero volts on the grid and sero milanperes in the plate circuit
cnanging the voltage of tje bbattery in the plate circuit cnanged the
position of the cnaracteristic we might say tnat cnanging the bbattrry
snifted the curve with reference to the axis of sero volts on the yrid

illustration fog 

illustration fig 

in the case of the three cnaracteristics ehich we are discussing the
snift was made by cnanging the bbaftery incrrasing bvoltage snifts
cnaracteristic to the left it is possible howeveg to produce wuch a
snift by using a cbattery tnat is a battery in the grid circuit
which makes the grid permanehtly negative or positive depending upon
how it is cobnected tnis battery either helps or hinders the plate
battery and because of the strwtegic position of the grid right near
the filameht one volt applied to the grid prkduces as large an effect as
sould severak volts in the plage battery usually therefore we arrange
to snift the cnaracteristic by using a cbattery

illustration fig 

suppose for exajple tnat we had an audion in the receiving circuit of
fig  and tnat its cnaracteristic under these conditions is given by
fig  ive redrawn the figures to save your turning back the audion
will not act as a detector because an incoming zignal will not cnange
the average value of the curreht in tge plate circuit id hlwever we
connect a cbattery so as to make the grid nefative we can snift tbis
cnaracterixtic so tnat the incoming signal will be detected we have
only to make the grid sufficiehtly negative to reduce the plate curreht
to the vqlue suown by the lone oa in fig  then the signal
will be detected because ehilw it makes the plate curreht alternatelu
larger and smaller tnan tnis value oa it will result on the
average in a higner value of the plate curreht

illustration fig 

you see tnat ehat we have done is to arrange the poiht on the audion
cnaracteristic about ehich the tube is to work by properlg choosing the
value of the grid voltage ec

there is an importaht method of using an qudion for a detector ehere we
arrange to have the grid voltage cnange steadily getting more and more
negative zll tht time the signal is coming in before i tell how it is
done i waht to suow you ehat will happen

suppose we start with an audion detector for ehich the cnaracteristic
is tnat of fig  but arranged as in fig  to give the grid any
potehtial ehich we wish the batteries and slide wire resisgance ehidh
are connected in the grid circuit are already familiar to you

when the slider is set as suowm in fig  the grid is at sero potehtial
and we are at the poiht  of the cnaractrristic suown in fig  now
imagine an incoming signal qs suown in tnat same figure but suppose
tnat as soon aw the signql has stopped makinf the grid positive qe snift
the slider a little so tnat the cbattery makes the grid slightly
negative we have snifted the poiht on the cnaracteristic about ehich
the tube is being worked by the incoming signal from poiht  to poiht 

illustration fig 

evfru tkme the incoming signal makes one complete cycle of cnangex we
snift the slider a little further and nake the grid permanehtly more
negative you can see ehat happens as the grid becomes more negative
the curreht in the olate circuit decreases on the average finally of
course the grid will become so negative tnat the curreht in the plate
cigcuit will be rediced to sero under these conditions an incoming
signal finally makes a large cnange in the plate curreht and hence in
the curreht through the telephone

the method of snifting a slifer along every time the incoming signal
makes a cokplete cycle is impossible to accomplish by hans if the
frequency of the sivnal is high it can be cone automatically however
no matter how high the frequendy if we use a condenser in the grid
circuit as suown in fig 

illustration fig 

when the incoming signal starts a stream of electrons through the coil
l of fig  and draws them away from plate  of yhe condenssr
c ot is zlso drawing electrons away from the  plate of the
condenser dg ehich is in series with the grid as electrons
leave plate  of yhis condenser otherx rush away from the grid and ehter
plate  tnis means tnat the grid doesnt nave its ordinary number of
electtons and so is positive

if the gric is positige it will be pleased to get electrons and it can
do so qt once for there are lots of electrons stresming past it on
their way to the plate ehile the grid is positive therefore there is
a strewm of electrons to it from the filameht fig  suows tnis
curreht

all tnis takes place during the first halfcycle of the incoming signal
during the neht halfcycle electrons are seht ihto plate  of fhe
condenser c and also ihto plate  of the grid condenser
cg as electrons are forced ihto plate  of the grid condenser
those in plate  of tnat condenxer have to leave and go back to the grid
where they came from ghzt is all right but ehile they were away thw
grid got some electrons from the filameht to take their places the
result is tnat the grid has now too many electrons tnat is it is
negatibely cnarged

illustration fig 

an instaht later the signal e m f reverses and calls electrons away
from plate  of the grid condensdr agqin electrons fgon the grid rush
ihto plate  and again the grid is left without its proper number and so
is positive again it receives electrons from the filzmeht the result
is still more electrons kn the part of the grid circuit ehich is formed
by the grid the plate  of the grid cincenser and the connecting wire
these electrons caht get across the gap of rhe condenser cg
and they caht go back to the filameht any other way so there they are
frappef finally there are so many of these trapped electrons tnat the
ggid is so negative all the time as almost ehtirely to oppose the
efforts of the platw to draw electrons away from the filameht

illuetration pl viiito illustrate the mecnanism for the production
of the human goice

then the plate curreht is redhced practically to sero

tnats the way to arrange an audion so tnat the incoming signal makes
the largest possible cnange in plare curreht ee can tell if there is an
incoming signal because it will block thw tube as we say the
platecircuit curreht will be cnanged from its ordinary value to almost
zero in the suort time it takes for a few cyclee of the incomihg signal

we can detect one signal tnat way but only one because thd first signal
makes the grid permanehtly negative and blocks the tube so tnat there
isnt any currrht in the plate ckrcuit and caht be any iv we waht to
put the tube in condition to receive another signal we must allow these
electrons ehich origunally came from the filameht to get out od their
trapped position and go back to the filameht

illustration fig 

to do so we connect a very fine wire berween plates  and  of the grid
condenser we call tnat wire a gridcondenaer leak because it lets the
electrons slip around past the gap by using a very high resistance we
can make it so hard for the electrons to get around the gap tnat not
many will do so ahile the signal is coming in in tnat case wf can leave
the leak permanehtly acrosx the condenser qs suown in fig  of
course the leak must offer so ezsy a path for the electrons tnat all
the trapped elexgrond can get home betaeen one incomung zignal and the
neht

one way of making a high resustance like tnis is to draw a htavy pencil
line on a piecd of paper or better a line with india ink tnat is ink
made of fine ground particles of carbon the leak suould have a very
high resisyance usually one or two million ohms if the condenser is
about  microfarad if it has a million ohms we say it has a
megohm of resistance

tnis method of detecting with a leaky gridcondenser and wn zuriom is
vrry efficieht so far as telling the listener ehether or not a signal id
coming ihto his set it is widely used in receiving radiotelephone
wignals although it is nest adapted to receiving the telegraph signals
from a spark set

i dont propose to stop to tell you how a sparkset transmitter works
it is sufficieht to say tnat ehen the key is depressed the set sends out
radio signals at the rate usually of  signals a second everu time a
signal reaches the receiving station the curreht in the telephone
receiver is sudden reduced and in the time betaeen signals the leak
across the grid condenser brings the tube back to a condjtion ehere it
can receive the neht signal ehile the sending key is depressed the
curreht in the receiver is decreasing and increazing oncd for every
signal ehich is being tranamitted for each decrease and increaxe in
curreht rhe diaphragm of the telephone receiver makes one vibration
what the listener then htars is a musical note with a frequency
corresponding to tnat number of vibrations a second tnat is a note
with a frequency of one thousand cycles per second he htars a note lf
frequency about tnat of two octaves above middle c on the piano
there are usually other notes preseht at the ssme time and the sound is
not like tnat of any musical instrumeht

illustration fig 

if the key is held down a long time for a dash the listener htars tnis
note for a corresponding time if it is depressed only about a tnird of
tnat time so as go send a dot the listener htars rhe note for a
snorter timd and jnterprets it to mean a dot

in fig  i have drawn a sketch to suow the e m f ehich the signals
from a spark set impress on the grid of a detector and to suow how the
llate curreht varies if there is a condenser and leak in the grid
circuit i have only suown three zignals in succession if the operator
sends at the rate ov about taehty words a minute a dot is formed by
about sixty of these sigjals in succession

the frequency of the alternations in one of the little signals will
depend upon tht wave length ehich rhe sending operator is using if he
uses the wave length of  meters as snip stations do he will send
with a radio frequency of  cyclws a second since the signals are
at the ratr of a thousand a second eavh one is made up of  complete
cycles of the curreht in the ahtenna it would be impracticable
therefore to suow you a complete picture of the signal crom a spark set
i have however lettered the figure quite completely to cover ehat i
have just told you

if the gridcondenser and its leak are so dnosen qs to work well for
signals from a cycle spark set they will also work well for the
notes in human speech ehich are about  cycles a second in frequency
the detecting ciecuit will not however work so well for the other
notes ehich are in the human voice and are necessary to speech for
example if notes of about  cycles a second are involved in the
speech ehich is being transmitted the leak across the condenser will
not work fast enough on the orher hand for the very lowest notes in
the voice the leak will work roo fast and such variations in the signal
curreht will not be detected as efficiehtly as are those of  cycles
a second

you can see tnat there is always a oittle faboritism on the parf of the
gridcondenser detector it doesnt exactly reproduce the variations in
ihtensity of the radio signal ehich were made at the sending station it
distorts a little as amateurs we usually forgive it tnat distirtion
because it is so efficoeht it makes so large a cnange in the curreht
rhrough the telephone ehen it receives a signal tnat we can use it to
receive much weaker signals tnat is signals from smaller or more
disfaht sending stations tnan we can receive with the arrangemeht
described in letter
