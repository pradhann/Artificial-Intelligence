Test-1 for barranca game (make-barranca-game 3 3))
Expected Outcome:As mentioned in the comments of driver.scm, we expect the following
paths to be explored:
a) (1 3) (2)
b) (1 2) (3)
After exploring these two paths, the root node will update it's v and alpha
to be -1. It now starts a new recursive call when MAX chooses 2.
c) (2 3) (1)
After this call, the value of MIN node doing the recursive call
updates v=-1. Since alpha is -1 as well, the path ((2 1) (3)) will be
pruned.
d) ((3 2) (1))
Similarly, the path ((3 1) (2)) will be pruned. MAX is losing in all the
cases, so it returns the first evaluated action, choosing 1, as the best
available action.

Result of running alpha-beta-search:
MAX state (#t () () (1 2 3))
MIN state (#f (1) () (2 3))
MAX state (#t (1) (2) (3))
MIN state (#f (3 1) (2) ())

Test-2 for barranca game (make-barranca-game 4 8))
Expected Outcome:As mentioned in the comments of driver.scm, we expect the following
paths to be explored:
a) (3 1) (4 2)
b) (4 1) (3 2)
After exploring these two paths, the root node will update it's v and beta
to be -1. It now starts a new recursive call when Min chooses 3.
c) (2 1) (4 3)
After this call, the value of MAX node doing the recursive call
updates v=-1. Since beta is -1 as well, the path ((4 1) (2 3)) will be
pruned.
d) ((2 1) (3 4))
Similarly, the path ((3 1) (2 4)) will be pruned. Goes back to the first node,
we have :
e) ((3 2) (4 1))
f) ((4 2) (3 1))
g) ((1 2) (4 3))
h) ((4 2) (1 3))
i) ((1 2) (3 4))
j) ((3 2) (1 4))
This return a evaluation number of action 2 is 1, which update the alpha to 1.
Following prune is similar, for action 3 and action 4, we have:
k) ((2 3) (4 1))
l) ((4 3) (2 1))
m) ((2 4) (3 1))
n) ((3 4) (2 1))
While ((1 3) (4 2)), ((4 3) (1 2)), ((1 3) (2 4)), ((2 3) (1 4)), ((1 4) (3 2)),
((3 4) (1 2)), ((1 4) (2 3)), ((2 4) (1 3)) are all pruned.
