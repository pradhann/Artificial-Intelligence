Code cited:
Nripesh Pradhan's previous Lab1 for nest function

Jerod Weinman's given code and documentation for cutoff-minimax-search, 
cutoff-max-value and cutoff-min-value was used as 
the basis of the code for alpha-beta search

Jerod Weinman's code for display the state and utility was used 
for displaying the process of alpha-beta search

Jerod Weinman's simple-mancala-eval provides some guidances for
the best-mancala-eval we wrote. 

Jerod Weinman's code for barranca is used for testing

Pseudo-Code:
Pseudo-Code for alpha-beta search was obtained from the textbook for this class.
