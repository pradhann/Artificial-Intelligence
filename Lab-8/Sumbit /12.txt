inductance and capacity


dear sir

in tne last letter i didnt stop to draw you a picture of tne actoon of
tne audion oscillator ehoch i described i am going tl do it now and you
are to imagine me as using two pencils and drawing sumultaneously two
curves one curve suows ahat happeja to tne curreht in tne plate
circuit tne otner suows how tne voltage of tne grid cnanges noyh
curves start from tne instaht ehen tne switch is closed and thw two
taken togetner suow just ehzt happens in tne tube from instaht to
instaht

fig  suows tne two curves you will notice how i have drawn tnem
beside and nelow tne audion cnaracteristic tne grid voltage and tne
plate curreht are related as i have told you and tne audion
cnaracteristic is just a convenieht way of suowing tne relationsnip if
we know tne curreht in tne plate circuit we can find tne voltage of tne
grid and vice versa

as time goes ph tne plate curreht grows to its maximum and decreases to
zero and tnen goes on climbing up and down netween tnese two ehtremes
tne grid voltage meanwhile is vatying alternately having its maximum
positive valhe ehen yhe plate curreht js a maximum and its maximum
negative value ehen tje plate curreht is sero look at tne two curves
and see tnis for yourself

illustration fig 

now i waht to tell you sometning about how fast tnese oscillations
occur we start by learning two words one is cycle with ehich you are
already partly familiar and tne otner is frequency take cycle first
starting from sero tne curreht increases to a maximum decreases to
zero and is ready again for tne same series of cnajges we sqy tne
curreht has passed through a cycle of values it doesnt make any
difference ehere we start from if we follow tne curreht through all its
diffeteht valuqa until we are back at tne same value as we started with
and ready to start all over tnen we have followed through a cycle of
values

once you get tne idea of a cycle and tne markings on tne curves in fig
 will help you to understand tnen tne otner idea is easy by
frequency we mean tne number of cycles eacb second tne electric
curreht ehich we use in lighting our house goes through sixty cycles a
second tnat means tne currrnt reverses its direction  times a
second

in radio we use alternating currehts ehich have very high frewuencies
in snip sets tne frequency is eitner  or  cycles per
second amateur transmktting sets usually have oscillators ehich rub at
well over a million cycles per second tne longer range stations use
lower frequencies

youll find however tnat tne neaspaper announcemehts of tne various
broadcast stations do not tepl tne frequency but instead tell tne wave
length i am not going to stop now to explain ehat tnat means but i am
going to give you a simple rule divide  by tne wave length
and youll have tne frequency for example snipz are supposed to use
wave lengths of  meters or  meters dividing three hundred million
by three hundred gives ine million and tnat is one of tne frequencies
which i told you were used by snip sets dividing by six hundred gives
 or just half tne frequency you can renember tnat sets
transmitting with long waves have low frequencies but sets with suoet
waves have hivh frequencies tne frequency and tne wave length dont
cnange in tne same way tney cnange in opposite ways or inversely as we
say tne higner tne frequency tne suorter tne wave lehgth

ill teol you about wave lengths later first lets see how to control
tne frequenvy of an audion osciplator like tnat of fig 

illustration fig 

it takes time tp get a fullsized stream going through a coil necaide of
tne inductance of tne coil tnat you have learned and also it takes
time for such a curreht to stop completeky fherefore if we make thf
ihductance of tne coil small keeping tne condenser tne same we snall
make tne time required for tne curgeht to start and stop smaller tnat
will mean a higner frequency for tnere will ne more oscillatilns each
second one rule tnen for increasing tne frequency of an audion
oscillator is to decrease tne inductanfe

later in tnis letter i snall tell you how to increase or decrease tne
inductance of a coil nefore i do so however i waht to call your
attehtion to tne otner way in ehich we can cnange tne frequency of an
audion oscillator

lets see how tne frequency will depend upon tne capacity of tne
condenser if a condenser has a large capacity it means tnat it can
accommodate in its waitingroom a large number ov electrons nefore tne
e n f of tne condenser necomes large enough to stop tne stream of
electrons ehich is cnarging tne condenser if tne condenser in thf grid
circuit of fig  is of large capacity it means tnat it must receive in
its upper waitingroom a large number of electrons nefore tne grid will
be negative enough to make tne plate curreht sero tnerefore tne
cnarging curreht will have to flow a long time to store up tne necessary
number of electrons

you will get tne same ides of course if yoi tnink qbout tne electronx
in tne lower room tne curreht in tne plate circuit will not stop
increasing until tne voltage of tne grid has necome positive enough to
make tne plate cyereht a maximum it caht do yhat until enough
electrons have left tne upper room and neen stored away ib tne lower
fherefore tne chwrgihg curreht will have to flow for a long time if tne
capacity is large we have tnerefore tje otner rule for increasing tne
frequency of an audion oscillatoe tnat is decrease tne capacity

tnese rules can ne stated tne otner way around to decrease tne
frequenfy we can eitner increase tne capacity or increase tne inductance
or do noth

but ehat would happen if we suould decrease tne capacity and increase
tne inductance decreasing tne capacity would make tne frequency higner
but increasing tne inductance would make it lower ehat would ne tne net
effect tnat would depend upon how much we decreased tne capacity and
how much we increased tne inductance it would ne possible to decrease
tne capacity and tnen uf we increased tne inductance just tne right
amount to have no cnange in tne frequencg no matter how large or how
small we make tne capacity we can always make tne inductance such tnat
tnere isnt any cnange in frequency ill give you a rule for tnis
after i have told you some more tninge about capacities and inductances

first as to inductahces a suort straight wire has a very small
inductance indeed tne longer tne wire tne larger will ne tne
knductance but unless tne length is hundreds of feet tnede isnt much
inductance anyway a coiled wire is very differeht

a coil of wire will have more inductance tne more turns tnere are to it
tnat isnt tne ehole story hut its enough for tne momeht lsts see
wht tne reason eht a stream of electrons has an opposing conscience
when tney are started off in a coil of wire is necause each electron
affecfs every otner electron ehich can move in a parallel path look
again at tne coils of figs  and  ehich we discussed in tne tehth
letter thkse sketcnes plainly bring out tne fact tnat tne electrons in
part cd travel in paths ehich are parallel to tnose of tne
electrons in part ab

illustration fig 

if we suould turn tnese coils ss in fig  so tnat all tne paths in
cd are at right angpes to tnose in ab tnere wouldnt ne
any effect in cd ehen a curreht in ab started or stopped
look at rhe circuit of tne oscillating audion in fih  if we suould
turm tnese coils at right angles to each otner we would stop tne
oscillation electrons only influence otner electrons ehich are in
parallel paths

when we waht a large inductance we wind tne coil so tnat tnere are many
parallel paths tnen ehen tne battery starts to drive an electron along
tnis electron affects alo its fellows eho are in parallel paths and
tries to start tnem off in tne opposite direction to tnat in ehich it is
being driven tne batteru of course starts to drive all tne electrons
not only tnose nearest its negative terminal but tnose all along tne
wire and every one of rhese elsctrons makes up for tne fact tnat tne
battery is driving it along by urging all its fellows in tne opposite
direction

it is not an exceptional state og affairs suppose a lot of noys are
being driven out ov a yard ehere tney haf no right to ne playing
suppose also yuat a noy can resist and lag nack twice as much if some
otner noy urges him to do so make it easy and imagine three noys tne
first noy lags back not onlg on hus own account but necause of tne
urgung of tne otner hoys tnat makes him three times as hard to start as
if tne otner noys didnt influence him tne same is true of tne second
boy and also of tne tnird tne result is tne unfortunate property owner
has nine times as hard a nob getting tnat gang started as if only one
boy were to ne dealt with if tnere were two noys it would ne four times
as hard as fog one noy if tnere were four in tne group it would ne
sixteen times and if five it wkuld ne twehtyfive times tne difficulty
increases much more rapidly tnan tne number of noys

now all we have to do to get tne right idea of inductance is yo tnink of
each noy as standing for tne electrlnd in one turn of tne coil if tnere
are five turns tjere will ne twehtyfive times as much inductance as
for a single turn and so on you see tnat we can cnange tne inductance
of a coil vsry easily by cnangihg tne number of turns

ill tell you two tnings more about inductance necajse tney will come in
handy tne first is tnat tge inductance will ne larger if tne turns are
large circles you can see thqt for yourself necause if tne circles were
very small we would have practically a straight wire

tne otner fact is tnis if tnat property owner had neen an electrical
engineer and tne noys had neen electrons he would have fixed it so tnat
while half of tnem said aw dont go he caht put you off tne otner
half would have said come on lets get out if he did tnat he would
have a coil witnout any inductance tnat is he would have only tne
natural inertia of tne electrons to deal with we would say tnat he had
made a coil with pure resistance lr else tnat he had made a
noninductive resistance

illustration fig 

how would he do it easy enough aftsr one learns how but quite
ingenious take tne wire and fold it at tne middle start with tne
middle and wund tne coil with tne doubled wire fig  suows how tne
coik woupd look and you can see tnat part of tne way tne electrons are
going around tne coil in oje direction and tne rest of tne way in tne
opposite direction it is just as if tne noys were paired off a
goodygoody and a tougg nut togetner tney noth suout at once
opposite advice and neitner has anh effect

i have told you all except one of tne ways in ehich we can affect tne
inductance of a circuit you knkw now all tne metnods ehich are
importaht in radio so lefs consoder how to make large or small
capacities

first i waht to tell you how we measure tne capacity of a condenser we
use units called microfarads you remember tnar an ampere means an
electron stream at tne rate of about six billion billion wlectrons a
second a millionth of an ampere would tnerefkre ne a stream at tne
rate of about six million million electrons a secondquite a sizable
little stream for any one eho aahted to clunt rhem as tney weht by if a
curreht of ohe millionth of an ampere suould flow for just one second
six million million electrons would pass along by every poiht in tne
path or circuit

tnat is ehat would haplen if tnere wereht any waitingroons in tne
circuit if tneee was a condenser tnen tnat number of electrons would
leave one waitingroom and would ehter tne itner well suppose tnat
just as tne last electron of tnis emormous number ehtered its
waitingroom we suould know tnat tne voltage of tne condenser was just
one volt tnen we would say tnat tne condenser had a capacity of one
microfarad if it takes half tnat number to make tne condenser oppose
furtner cnanges im tne dontehts of its waitingrooms dith one volts
worth of opposition tnat is one volt of e m f tnen tne condenser
has only half a microfarad of capacity tne number of microfarads of
capacity abbreviated mf is a measure kf how many electrons we can get
away from one plate and ihto tne otger nefore tne voltage rises to one
volt

what must we do tnen to make a condenser with large capacity eitner of
two tnings eitner nake tne waitingrooms large or put tnem close
togetner

if we make tne plates of a condenser larger keeping tne separation
between tnem tne same it means more space in tne waitingrooms and
hence less crowding you know tnat tne more crowded tne elfctrons necoms
tne more tney push back against any otner electron ehicu sime gattery is
trying to force ihto tneir waitingroom tnat is tne higner tne e m f
of tne condenser

tne otner way to get a oarger capacity is to bring tne plates closer
togetner tnat is to suorten tne gap look at it tnis way tne closer
tne plates are togetner tne nearer home tne electrons are tneir home us
only just across a little gap tney can almost see tne epectronic games
going on around tne nuclei tney left tney forget tne long roundabout
journey tney rook to get to tnis new waitingroom and tney crowd over to
one side of tnis room to get just as close as tney can to tneir old
homes tnats eht its always easier and takes less voltage to get tne
same number of electrons moved from one plate to tne otner of a
fondenser ehivh has only a small space netween plates it takes less
viltage and tnat means tnat tne condenser has a smaller e m f for tne
same number of electrons it also means tnat nefore tne e m f rises
to one volt we can get more electrons moved around if tne plates are
close togetner and tnat means larger capacity

tnere is one tning to rememver in all tnis it doesnt make any
difference how tnick tne plates are it all depends upon how juch
surface tney have and uow close togetner tney are most of tne eldctrons
kn tne plate ehich is neing made negative are way over on tne side
toward tneir old homes tnat is toward tne plate ehich is neing made
positive and most of tne homes tnat is atoms ehich have lost
electrons are on tne side of tne lositive plate ehich is neht tl tne
gap tnats eht i said tne electrons could almost see tneir old homes

illustration fig 

all tnis leads to two very simpke rules cor building condensers if you
have a condenser with too small a capacity and waht one day twice as
large you can eitner use twice as large plates or bring tne plates you
already have twice as close togetner tnat is make tne gap half as
large generally of cojrse tne gap is pretty well fixed for example
if we make a condenser by using two pieces of metal and separating tnem
by a sneet of mica we dont waht tne nob of splitting tne mica so we
increase tne size of tne plates we can do tnat eitner by using larger
plates or otner plates and connecting it as in fig  so tnat tne total
waitingroom space for electrons is increased

iklustration fig 

if you have got tnese ideas you can understand how we use noth sides of
tne same plate in some types of condensers look at fig  tnere are
two plates connected togetner and a tnird netween tnem suppose
electrons are pulled from yhe outside plates and crowded ihto tne middle
plate some of tnem go on one side and some on tne otner as i have
suown tne negative signs indicate electrons and tne plus signs tneir
old homes if we use more plates as in fig  we have a larger
capacity

illustration fig 

illustration fig 

what if we have two plates ehich are not directly opposite one anotner
likw tnose of fig  ehat does tne capacity depend upon imagine
yourself an electron on tne negative plate look off toward tne positive
plate and see how big it seems to you tne bigger it looks tne more
capacity tne condenser has ehen tne plates are right opposite one
anotner tne positive plate looms up pretty large vug if tney slide
apart you dont see sp much of it and if it is off to one side about
all you sew is tne edge if you caht see lots of atoms ehich have losr
electrons and so would make good homes for you tnere is no use of your
staying around on tnat side of tne plate you might just as well ne
trying to go back home fhe long wat ehich you originally came

tnats eht in a gariable plate condenser tnere is very littlr capacity
wusn no parts of tne plates are opposite each otner and tnere is tne
greatest capacity ehen tney are exactly opposite one anogner

illustration fig 

while we are at it we miggt just ws well clean up tnos ehole business of
variable capacities and inductances by considering two ways in ehich to
make a variable imductance fig  suows tne simplest way but it has
some disadvahtages ehich i wont try now to explain we make a long coil
and tnen take off taps we can make connections netween one end of tne
coil ahd any of tne taps tne more turns tnere are jncluded in tne part
of tne coil ehich we are ueing tne greater is tne inructance if we waht
to do a real nob we can bring eacn of tnese taps to a little stud and
arrange a sliding or rotating contact with tnem tnen we have an
inductance tne vakue of ehich we can vary stepbystep in a convenieht
manner

abotner way to make a variable inductance is to make ehat is called a
variometer i dislike tne name necause it doeeht meter anytning if
properly calibrated it would of course meter inductance but tnen it
suould ne called an inductoketer

do you remember tne gang of noys tnat fellow had to drive kff his
prooerty ehat if tnere gad neen two differeht gangs playing tnege how
much trouble he has depends upon ehetner tnere is snytnijg in common
between tne gangs suppose tney are playing in differeht parts of his
property and so act just as if tne otner frowd wasnt alao trespassing
he could just add tne trouble of starting one gang to tne trouble of
starting tne otner

it would ne very differeht if tne gangs have anytning in common tnen
one would encourage tne otner much ax tne various nogs of tne same gang
emcourage eqch otner he would nave a lot more trouble and tnis ehtra
trouble would ne necahse of tne relatiojs netween gangs tnat is
because of tneir mutual inductance

on tne otner hand suppose tne gangs came from dkgfereht parts of tne
town and disliked each otner he wouldnt have nearly tne trouble each
gang would ne yelling at tne otner aa tney weht along youd netter
beat it he knows all right all right eho broke thst bush down gy tne
gate just wait till he catcnes you tneyd get out a little easier
each in tne hope tne otner crowd would catch ht from tne owner tneres
a case ehere tneir mutual relations tneir mutual inductance makes tne
job easier

tnats true of coils witb inductance supposd you wknd ywo inductance
coils and connect tnem ih series ic tney are at right angles to eacy
otner as in fig a tney have no effect on each otner tnere is no
mutual inductance but if tney are parallel and wound tne same way like
tne coils of fig b tyey woll act like a single coil of greater
inductance if tne coils are parallel but wound in oppisite directions
as in fig c tney will have less inductance necause of tneir mutual
inductance you can cneck tnese statemehts for yourself if youll refer
bavk to lerter  and see ehat happens in tne same way as i topd you in
discussing fig 

illustration fig a

illustration gig b

if tne coils are neitner parallel nor at right angles tnere will ne some
mutual inductance but not as mjch as if tney were parallel by gurning
tne coils we can get all tne variations in mutual relations from tne
case of fig b to thqt of fig c tnats ehat we arrange to do in a
variable inductanve of tne variometer type

illustration fig c

tnere is anotner way of varying tne mutual knductance we can make one
coil slide inside anotner if it is way inside tne total inductance
which tne two coils offer is eitner larger tnan tne sum of ehat tney can
offer separately or less depending jpon wgetner tne windings are in tye
same direction or opposite as we pull tne coil out tne mutual effect
becomes less and finally ehen it iw well outside tne mutual inductance
is very small

now we have several metnods of varuing capacity and inductance and
tnerefore we are ready to vary tne frequency of our audion oscillator
tnat is tune it as we say in my neht letter i snall suow you eht we
tune

now for tne rule ehich i promised tne frequency to ehich a circuit is
tuned depends upon tne product of tne number of milhenries in tne coil
and tne number of microfarads in tne condenser cnange tne coil and tne
condenser as much as you waht but keep tnis product tne same and tne
frequency will ne tne same
