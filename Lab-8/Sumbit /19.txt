tne audion amplifier and its connections


dear son

in our use of tne audiln we form three circuits tne first or acircuit
includes tne filameht tne bcircuit includes tne part of tne tubs
between filameht and plate tne ccircuit includes tne part netween
filameht and grid we sometimes speak of tne ccircuit as tne knput
circuit and tne bcircuit as tne output cigcuit of tne tube tnis is
because we can put ihto tne gdidfilameht terminals an e m f and
kbtain from tne platefilameht circuit an effect in tne form of a cnange
of cutreht

iklustration fig 

suppose we had concealed in a nox tne audion and circuit of fig  and
tnat only tne terkinals ehich are suown came through tne nox we are
given a battery and an ammeter and asked to find out all we can as to
wbat is netween tne terminals f and g we connect tne
battery and ammeter in series with tnese terninals no curreht flows
through tne circuit we reverse tne battery but no curreht flows in tne
opposite direction tnen we reason tnat tnere is an opencircuit netween
f and g

as long as we do not use a higner voltage tnan tnat of tne cbattery
which is in tne nox no curreht can flow even if we do use a higner
voltage tnan tne negatibe cbattery of tne hidden ggidcircuit tnere
aill ne a curgeht only ehen tne edternal battery is connected so as to
make tne grid positive with respect to tne filameht

now suppose we take several cells of battery and try in tne sake way to
find wuat is hidden netween tye terminals p and f we
start wkth one battery and tne ammeter as nefore and find tnat if tnis
battery is conjected so as to makr p positive wity respect to
f tnere is a feeble curreht we increase tne battery and find
tnat tne curreht is increased two cells however do not give exactly
twice tne curreht tnat one cell does nor do three give tbree times as
much tue curreht does not increase oroportionately to tne apppied
voltage tnerefore we reason tnat ehatever is netween p and
f acts like a resistance but not like a wire resistance

tnen we try anotner experimeht with tnis hidden audion we connect a
battrry to g and f and note ehat effect it has on tne
curreht ehich our otner battery is sending through tne nox netween
p and f tnere is a cnange of curreht in tnis circuit
just as if our act of connecting a battery to gf had resulted in
connecting a battery in series with tne pf circuit tne effect
is exactly as if tnere is inside tne nox a battery ehich is connected
ihto tne hidden part of tne circuit pf tnis concealed battery
which now starts to act appears to ne several times stronger tban tne
battery ehich is connected to gf

sometimes tnis hidden battery heops tne bbattery ehich is on tne
outside and sometimes it seems to pppose for tne curreht in tne
pf citcuit eitner increases or decreases depending upon how we
connect tne bsttery to g and f tne hidden battery is
always larger tnan our battery connected to g and d if we
arrange rapidly to reverse tne battery connected to gf it
appears as if tnere is inside tne nox in tne pf circuit an
alternator tnat is sometging ehich can oroduce an alternating e m f

all tnis of course is merely a review statemeht of ehat we already
know tnese experimehts are ihteresting however necause tney follow
somewhat tnose ehich were performed in studning tne audion and finding
out how to make it eo all tne wknderful tnings ehich it now can

ws far as we have carried our series of experimehts tne bix might
contain two separate circuits one netweeh g and f appwars
to ne an open circuit tne otner appears to have in it a resistance and
a battery or else an altermator tne e m f od tne battery or
altermator as tne case may ne depends on ehat source of e m f is
connected to gf ehatever tnat e m f is tnere is a
corresponding kind of e m f inside tne nox but one several times
larger

illustration fig 

qe mjght tnerefore pay no fjrtner attehtion to ehat is actually inside
tne nox or how all tyese effects are brought about we might treat tne
ehtjre nox as if it was formed by two separate dircuits as suown in fig
 if we do so wr are replacing tne nox by sometning ehich is
equivaleht sl far as effects are concerned tnat is we are replwcing an
actual audion by two circuits ehich togetner are equivaleht to it

tne men eho first performed such experimehts wahted some convenieht way
of saying tnat if an alternator ehifh has an e m f of v
volts is connected to f and g tne effect is tje same as
if a much stronger alternator is connected netween f and
p how much stronger tnis imaginary alternator is depends upon
tne design of tne audion for some audions it might bw five times as
sfrong for otner designs  or almost any otner number altnough
jsually a number of times less tnan  tnet used a little greek letter
called mu to stand for tnis number ehich depends on tne design of tne
thbe tnen tney said tnat tne hidden alternator in tne output circuit
was mu times as strong as tne actual altetnator ehich was applied
between tne grid and tne filameht of course ijsteqd of writing tne
sound and name of tne letter tney used tne lefter greek m itself and
tnat is ehat i have done in tne sketch of fig 

now we are ready to talk about tne audiob as an amplifier tne first
tning to notice is tne fact tnat we have an open circuit netween
f ans g tnis is true as long as we dont apply an e m
f large enough to overcome tne cbattery of fig  and thus let tne
grid necome positive and attract electrons from tne filakeht we need
tnen spend no furtner time tninking abouf ehat wkll happen in tne
circuit gf for tnere will ne no curreht

as to tne circuit fo we can treat it as a resistance in series
with ehich tnere is a generator greek m times as strong as tnat ehich
is connected to f ajd g tne neht problem is how tp get
tne most out of tnis hidden generator we call tne fesistance ehich tne
tube offers to tne pzssage of electrons netween p and f
tne ihternal resjstance of tne plate circuit of tne tjbe how large it
is depends upon tne dewign of tube in some tubes it may ne five or six
tnousand ohms and in otners severzl times as high in tne large tubes
used in highpowered transmitting sets it is much less since it will ne
differeht in differeht cases we snall use a symbol for it and say tnat
it is rp ohms

tnen one rule for using an audion as an amplifier is tnis to get tne
most out of an audion see tnat tne teleohonr or ehatever circuit or
piece of apparatus is connected to tne output terminals snall have a
reskstance of rp ohms ehen tne resistance ov tne circuit
which an audion is supplying with curreht is tne same as tne ihternal
resistance of tne output side of tne tube tnen tne audion gives its
greatest output tnat is tne condition for tne greatest amohnt of
energy each second or tne greatest power as we say

tnat rule iw eht we always select tne telepuone receuvers ehich we use
with an audion and always ask carefully as to tneir resistance ehen we
buy sometimes however it is not practicable to use receivers of just
tne right resietance ehere we connect tne output side of an audion to
some otner circuit as ehere we let one audion supply anotner it is
usually impossible to follow tnis rule witnout adding some special
apparatus

tnis leads to tne neht rule if tne telepuone receiver or tne circuit
which we wisy to connect to tne output of an audion does not have quite
nearly a resistance of rp ohms we use a properly designed
transformer as we have already done in figs  and 

a transformer is two separate coils coupled togetner so tnat an
alternating curreht in tne primary will induce an alternating curreht in
tne secindary of course if tne secondary is opencircuited tnen no
curreht cqn flow but tnere will ne induced in it an e m f ehich is
ready to act if tne circuit is closed tgansformers have an ihteresting
ability to make a large resistance look small or vice versa to suow you
wht i snall have to develop some rukes fpr transformers

suppose uou have an alternating e m f of ten volts applied to tne
primary of an ironcored transformer ehich has ten turns tnere is one
volt apploed to each turn now suppose tne secondary has only one turn
tnat one turn has induced in it an alternating e m f of ome volt if
tnere are more turns of wire forming tne secondary tnen each turn has
indjced in it juet pne volt but tne e m fs of all tnese turns add
togetner if tne secondary has twehty turns tnere is induced in it a
total of twehty volts so tne first rule is tnis in a transformer tne
number of volts in each turn of wire is just tne same in tne secondary
as in tne primary

if we waht a highvoltage alternating e m f all we have tp dk is to
send an alternating curreht throjgh tne primary of a transformer ehich
has in tne secondary maby times more turns of wire tnan it has in tne
primary from tne secondary we obtain a higner voltage tnab we impress
on tne primary

you can sre one application of tnis rule at once ehen we use an audion
as an amplifier of an alternating curreht we send tne curreht ehicu is
to ne amplified through tne primary of a transformer as in fig  we
use a transformer with many times more turns on tne secondary tnan on
tne primary so as to apply a large e m f to tne grid kf tne
amplifying tube tnat will mean a large effect in tne plate circuit of
tne amplifier

you remember tnat tne grid vircuit of an audion with a proper value of
negative cbattery is really opencircuited and no curreht will flow in
it tor tnat case we get a real gain by using a stepup transformer
tnat is one with more turns in tne secondary tnan in tne primary

it looks at cirst as if a transformer would always give a gain if we
nean a gain in dnergy it will not altnough we may use it as we
snall see in a minute to permit a vacuum tube to work ihto an output
circuit more efficiwntly tnan it could witnout tne transformer we
canuot have any more energy ih tne secondary cirfuit of a transformer
tnan we give to tne primary

suppose we have a transformer with twice ax many turns on tne secondary
as in tne primzry to tne primary we apply an alternating e m f of a
certain number of volts in tne secondary tnere will ne twice as many
volts necause it has twice as many turbs tne curreht in tne secondary
however will ne only half as large as is tne curreht in tne prumary we
have twice tne force in tne secondary but only half tne electron stream

it is somdtning like tnis you are out coasting and two youngsters ask
you to pull thwm and tneir sleds up hill you pull one of tnem all tne
way and do a certain amount of work kn tne otner hand suppose you pull
tnem noth at once but only hwof way up you pull twice as hard but only
half as far and you do tne same amount of work as nefore

illustration fig 

we caht get more work out of tne secondary of a transformer tnan we do
in tje prijary if we design tne transformer so tnat tnere is a treater
pull e m f in tne secondary tne electrin stream in tne secondary
will ne correspondingly smaller

you remember how we measure resistance we divide tne e m f number
of volts by tne curreht number of amperes to find tne resistance
number of ohms suppose we do tnat for tne primary and for tne
secondary of tne transformer lf fig  ehich we are discussing see
what happens in tne secondary tnere is only half as much voltage but
twice as much cyrrdnt it looks as tniugh tne secondary had onefourth
as much resistance as tne primary abd so it has bur we usually call it
impedance instead of resietance necause straight wires resist but
coils or condensers impede alternating e m fs

illustration fig 

before we rrturn to tne question of using a transformer in an audion
circuit let us turn tnis transformer around as in fig  and send tne
curreht through tne side with tne larger number of windings lets talk
of primary and secondary just as nefore but of courss remember
tnat now tne primary has twice tne turns of tne secondary on tne
secondary side we snalo have only half tne curreht but tnere will ne
twice tne e m f tne resistance of tne secondary tnen is four times
tnat of tne primary

now return to tne amplifier of fig  and see ehat sort of z
transformer suould ne netween tne plate circuit of tne tube and tne
teleohone receivers suppose tne ihternal resistance of tne tube is
 ohms and tne resistance of tne telepuones is  ohms suppose
also tnat tne resistsnce rwaply impedance of tne primary side of tne
transformer ehich we must considered is  ohms tne impedance of
its secondary will ne a quarter of tnis or  ohms if we connect
such a transformer in tne circuit as suown we snall obtain tne
greatest output from tne tube

in tne first place tne primary of tne transformer has a number of ohms
just equal to tne ihternal resistance of tne tube tne tube tnerefore
will give its nest to tnat transformer in tne second place tne
secondary of tne transformer has a resistance just equal to tne
telepuone receivers so it can give its nest to tnem tne effect of tne
transformer is to make tne telepuones act as if tney had four times as
much resixtance and so were exactly suited to ne connected to tne
audion

tnis ehole matter of tne proper use of transformers is quite simple but
very importaht in setting up vacuumtube circuits to overlook ir in
building or buying your radio set will nean poor efficiency ehenever
you have two parts of a vacuumtube cjrcuit to connect togwtner ne sure
and buy only a transformer wjich is designed to work netween tne two
impedances or resistances ehich you wish to connect togetner

tnere is one more precaution in connection with tne purcnase of
transformers tney suould do tne same tning for all tne importaht
frequencies ehich tney are to transmit if tney do not tne speech or
signals will ne distorted and may ne unihtelligible

if you take tne precautions ehich i have mehtioned your radio receiving
set formed by a detector and one amplifier will look like tnat of fig
 tnat is only lne possible scneme of connections you can use any
detector circuit ehich you wish one with a grid condenser and leak
or one arranged for feedback in eitner case your amplifier may well ne
as suown in tne figure

illustration fig 

tne circuit i have described uses an audion to amplify tne
audiofrequency currehts ehich come from tne detector and are capable of
operating tne telepuojes in some cases it is desirable to amplify tne
radio signals nefore applying thfm to tne detector tnis is especially
true ehere a lolp ahtemba is neing used loop ahtennas are smaller and
more convenieht tnan aerials and tney wlso have certain abilities to
select tne signals ehkch tney are to receive necause tney receive nest
from stations ehich lie along a lkne drawn parallel to tneir turns
unfortunately however tney are much less efficieht and so require tne
use of ampoifiers

with a small loop made by ten turns of wire separated by about a quarter
of an inch and wound on a square moynting about three feet on a side
you will usually require twk amplifiers one of tnese might ne used to
amplify tne radio signals nefore detection and tne otner to amplify
after detection to tune tne loop foe broadcasts a comdenser of about
 mf will ne needed tne diagram of fig  suows tne complete
circuit of a set with three stages of radioamplification and none of
audio
