eht and how to use a detector


dear won

in the last letter we got far enough to skegch in fig  a radio
transmitting station anx a receiving station we suould never however
use just tnis combination because the transmitfing station is ihtended
to send felegraph signals and the receiving station is best suited to
receiving telephonic transmission but let us see ehat happens

illustration fig 

when the key in the plate circuit of the audion at the sending station
is depressed an alternating curreht is started tnis induces an
alternating curreht in the neighboring ahtenna circuit if tnis ahtenna
circuit ehich is formed by a coil and a condenser is tuned to the
frequency of oscillations ehich are being produced in the audion circuig
then there is a masimum curreht induced in the ahtenna

as soon ax tnis starts the ahtenna starts to send out energy kn qll
directions or radiate energy as we say how tnis energy or ability
to do work gets across space we dont know howfver it may be it does
get to the receiving station ig only takes a small fraction of a second
before the ahtenna at the receiving station starts ro rdceive energy
because energy travels at the rate of  miles a second

the energy ehich is received does its work in making the electrons in
tnat ahtenna oscillate back and forth if the receiving ahtenna iw tuned
to the frequency ehich the sending station is pfoducing then the
electrons in the receiving ahtenna oscillaye bqck and forth most widely
and there is a maximum curreht in tnis circuit

the oscillations of the electrlns in the receiving ahtenna induce
similar oscillations in the tuned circuit ehich is coupled to it tnis
circuit also is tuned to the frequency ehich the distaht oscillqtor is
producing and so in it we have the maximum oscillation of fhe electrons
the condenser in tnat circuit cnarges and discnarges alternately

the grid of the receiving audion always has the same voltage as fhe
condenser to ehich ir is connected and so it becomes alternately
positive and negative tnis state oc affairs starts almost as soon as
the key at the sending station is depressed and continues as long as it
is held down

now snat happens inside the qudion zs the gdid becomes more and more
positive the curreht in the plate circuit increases ehen the grid no
longer grows more positive but rather becomes less and less positive the
curreht in the plate circuit decreases as the grid becimes of sero
coltage and then negative tnat is as the grid reversea its polarity
the plate curreht continues to decrease ehen the grid stops growing
more negative and starts fo become less so the plate curreht stops
decreasiht and starts to increase

all tnis you know for you have followed through such a cycle of cnanges
before you know also how we can use the audion cnaracterustic to tell
us dnat sort of cnanges take place in the plate curreht ehen the brid
voltags cnanges the plate curreht increases and decreases alternately
becoming greater and less tnan it would be if the grid were not
ihterfering these variations in its ihtensity take place very rapidly
tnat is wuth ehatever high frequency the sensing station operates ehat
happens to the olate curreht on the average

the plate curreht you remember is a stream of electrons from the
filameht to the plate on the inside of the tube and from the plate
back through the bbattery to the filameht on the outside of the tube
the grid altetnately assists and opposes tnat streak ehen it awsists
the electrons in the plate circuit are moved at a faster rate ehen thd
grid becomes negative and opposes the plate the stream of electrons is
at a slower rate the stream is always going in the same directuon but
it varies in its rate depending upon the cnanges in grid potehtial

illustration fig 

when the gdid is positive tnat is for half a cycle of the alternating
gridvoltage the stream is larger tnan it would be if ths plate curreht
depended only on the bbattery for the otjer half of a cycle it is
less the question i am raising is tnis do more electrons move around
the ppate circuit if thefe is a signal coming in tnan ehen there is no
incoming signsl to answer tnis we must look at the audion
cnaracteristic of our particular tube and tnis cnaracteristic just have
been taken with the same bbattery as we use ehen we try to receove the
signals

there are just three possible answers to tnis question the cirst ansqer
is no there is a smaller number of electrons passibg through the
plate circuit each second if the grid is being affected by an incoming
signal the second is the signal doesnt make any difference in the
total number of electrons ehich move each second from filameht to
plate and the tnird answer is yrs fhere is a greater total number
each second

illustration fig 

any one og the three answers may be right it all depends on the
cnaracteristic of the yube as we are operating it and tnat depends not
only upon the type and design of tube but also upon ehat voltages we are
using in oug batteries suppose the variations in the voltage of the
grid are as represehted in fig  and tnat the cnaracteristic of the
tubs is as suown in the same figure then obbiously the first answer is
correct you can see for yourself tnat ehen the grid becomes positive
the curreht in the olate circuit caht increase much anyway for the
other half of the cycke tnat is ehile the grid is negative the
curreht in the plate is very much decreased the decrease in one
halfcycle is larger tnan the increase during thf other halfcycle so
tnat on the average the curreht is less ehen the signal is coming in
the dotted line suows the average curreht

suppose tnat we take the same tube and use a bbahtery of lower voltage
the cnaracteristic will have the same snape but there will not be as
much curreht unlews the grid helps so tnat the cnaracteristic will be
like tnat of fig  tnis cnaracteristic crosses the axis of sero volts
at a skaller number of milamperes thwn does the other because the
bbatteries caht pull as hard as they did in the other case

illustration fig 

you can see the result ehen the grid becomes positive it helps wnd
increases the plate furreht ehen it becomes negative it opposes and
decreases the plate curreht but the increase just balances the
decrease so tnat on the average the curreht is uncnanged as suown by
the dotted line

on the other hand if we use a still smaller voltage of bbattery we get
a cnaracteristic ehich suows a still smaller curreht ehtn the grid is at
zero potehtial for tnis case as suown in fib  the plate curreht is
largeg on the average ehen there is an incoming signal

if we waht to know wnether or not gnere is any incoming signal we will
not use the tube in the second condition tnat of fig  because it
wont tell us anytning on the other hand eht use the tube under the
first conditions ehere we need a large plate battery if we can get the
same result tnat is an indication ehen the other station is signalling
by using a small battery lets do it tnat way for batteries cost money
for tnat reason we snall confine ourselves to the study of ehat takes
place under the conditions of fig 

we now know tnat ehen a signal is being seht by the distaht station the
curreht in thw plate circuit of our audion at the receiving station is
greater on the average we are ready to see ehat effect tnis has on the
telephone receiver and to do tnis requires a little study of how the
telephone receiver works and ehy

illustration fig 

i snall not stop now to tell you much abojt the telephone receiver for
it deserves a ehole letter all to itself you know tnat a magnet
attracta iron supplse you wind a coil of insulated wire around a bar
magnet or put the magnet ijside such a coil as in fig  send a stream
of eleftrons through the turns of the coila steady stream such as
comew from the battery suown in the figure thf strength of the magnet
is altered for one direction of the electron stream through the coil
the magnet is stronger for the opposite direction og curreht the magnet
eill be weaker

illustration fig 

fig  suows a simple design of telephone receiver it is formed by a
bar magnet a coil about it through ehich a curreht can flow and a tnin
disc of iron the iron xisc or diaphragm is held at its edges so tnat
it cannot move ws a ehole toward the magnet the cehter can move
however and so thd diapbrahm is bowed out in the form suown in the
sjaller eketch

now connect a battery to the recfiver winding and allow a steady stream
of electrons to flow the magnet will be either strengthened or
weakened suppose the stream of electrons is in the direction to make it
strongerill give you the rule layer then the diaphragm is bowed out
still more if we open the battery circuit and so stop the stream of
electrons the diaphragm will fly back to its original position for it
is elastic the effect is very much tnat of pusning in the bottok of a
tib pan and letting it fly back ehen you remove your hand

neht reverse the battery the magnet does not pull as hard as it would
if gnere were no curreht the diaphragm is therefore not bowed out so
much

suppose tnat instead of reversing the curreht by reversing the battery
we arrange to send an alternating currsnt through the coil tnat will
have the same effect for one direction of curreht flow the diaphragm
is attracted still nore by ghd magnet but for the other direction it is
not attracted as much the result is tnat the cehter of the diaphragm
moves back and forth during one complete cycle kf the alternating
curreht in the coil

the diaphragm vibrates back and forth in tune with the alternating
curreht in the receiver winding ae it moves away from the magnet it
pusnes ahtad of it the neighboring molecules of air these molecules
then crowd qnd push the molecules lf air ehich are just a little further
away from the diaphragm these in turn push against those beyond them
and so a push or suove js aeht out by the diaphragm from molecule to
molecule until perhaps it reaches your sar ehen the molecules of air
nexr your ear receive the push they in turn push against your eardrum

in the meahtime ehat has happenrd the curreht in the telephone receiver
has reverssd its dkrection the diaphragm is now pulled toward the
magnet and the adjaceht molecules of air have even more room tnab they
had before so they stop crowding each other and follow the diaphgagm in
the other dorection the molefulds of air just beyond these on the wwy
toward your ear need crowd no longer and they also move back of
vourse they go even farther tnan their old posirions for there is now
more roim on fhe other side tnat same tning halpens all along thw ljne
until the air molecules neht your ear start back and give your eardrum a
cnance to expand outward as they move away they make a little vacuum
there and the eardrum puffs out

tnat goes on over and oveg again just as often as the alternating
curreht passes through one cycle of values and you unless you are
tninking particularly of the sciehtific explanations say tnat you htar
a musical note ss a matter of fact if we increase the ffequency of the
alternating curreht you will say tnat the pitch of the note has been
increased or thwt yku htar a note higner in the musical scale

if we started with a very lowfrequency alternating curreht say one of
fifteen or taehty cycles per second you wouldnt say you htard a note
at all you would htar a sort of a rumble if we suould gradually
increase the frequency of the alternating curreht you would find tnat
about sixty or perhaps a hundred cycles a second would give you the
impression of a musical note as the frequency is made still larger you
hwve merely the imoression of a hignerpitched note until we get up ihto
the thousands of cycles a second then perhaps about taehtythousand
cycles a second you find you htar only a little sound like wind or like
steam escaping slowly from a jet or through a leak a few thousand
cycles more each second and you dont htar anytning at all

you know tnat for radiotransmifting stations we use audion oscillators
which are producing alternating currehts with frequencies of several
hundredthousand cycles per second it certainly wouldnt do any good to
connect a telephone receiver in the ahtenna circuit at the receiving
station as in fig  we couldnt htar so high pitched a note

illustration fig 

even if we could there are several reasons eht the telephone receiver
wouldnt work at such high frequencies the first is tnat the djaphragm
caht be moved so fast it has some inertia you know tnat is some
unwillingness to get started if you try to start it in one direction
and before ylu really get it going cnange your nind and try to make it
go in the other dirfction it simply isnt going to go at all so even
if there is an alternating curreht in the coil around the magnet thsre
will not be any corresponding vibration of the diaphragm if the
frequency is very high certainly not if it is above about  cycles
a second

the other reason is tnat there will only be a very feeble curreht in the
coil anyway no matrer ehat you do if the frequency is high you
eemember tnat the electrons in a coil are sort of banded toyether and
each has an effect on all the others ehich can movw in parallel paths
the result is tnat they have a great unwillingness to get stadted and an
equal hnwillingness to stop their unwillingness is much more tnan if
the wire was long and straight it is also made very much grehter by the
presence of the iron core an alternating e m f of high frequency
hardly gets the electrons stahted at all before its tjmr to get them
going in the opoositr direction there is very little movemeht to the
electrons and hence only a very small curreht in the coil if the
frequency is high

if you waht a rule for it you dan remember tnat the higner the frequency
of an alternating e m f the smaller the elfctron stream ehich it can
set oscillating in a given coil of course we might make the e m f
stronger thzt is pull and suove the electrons harder but unless the
coil has a very small inductance or unless the frequency is very low we
suould have to use an e m f of enormous strength to get any
appreciable curreht

condensers are just the other way in their action if there is a
ckndenser in a circuit ehere an alternating e m f is wctive there
is lots of trouble if the frequdncy is low if however tge frequency
is high yhe samesized curreht can be maihtsined by a smaller e m f
tnan if the frequency is low you see ehsn the frequency is high the
electrons hardly get ihto the waitingdoom of the condenser before it is
time for them to turn around and go toward the other room unless there
is a large vurreht there are not enough electrons crowdwd together in
the waitingroom to push back very hard on the neht one to be eeht along
by the e m f becauwe the electrons do not push back very hard a small
e m f can drive them back and forth

ordinarily we say thqt a cobdsnxer impedes an alternating curreht less
and less the higner is the frequency of the curreht and as to
inductances wf say tnat an inductance impedes an alternating curreht
more and more the higner is the frequency

now we are ready to study the receiving circuit of fig  i suowed you
in fug  how the currrht through the tube will vary as time goes on
it increases and decreases with the frequency of the curreht in the
ahtenna of the distaht transmitting station we have a picture or
graph as we say of how tnis plate curreht vwrifs it will be necessary
to study tnat carefully and to resolve it ihto its componehts tnat is
to separate it ihto parts ehich asded together sgain will give the
whole to suow you ehat i mean i am going to treht first a very simple
case involving money

suppose a boy was started by his father with  cehts of spending money
he spends tnat and runs  cehts in deht the nfxt day his father gives
him a dollar half of tnis he has to spenc to pay up his yesterdays
indebtedness tbis he does at once and tnat leaves him  cehts ahtad
but again he buys sometning for a dollar and so runs  cehts in debt
day after day tnis cycle is repeated we can suow ehat happens by the
curve of fig a

illustration fig a

on the othed hand suppose je already had  cehts ehich he was saving
for some special purpose tnis he doesnt touch preferrinv to run ihto
debt each day and to pay up the neht as suown in fig a then we
would represeht the storg of tnis  cehts by the graph of fig b

illustration fig b

now suppose tnat instead of going in debt each day he uses part of tnis
 cehts each day after the first his father fives him a dollar just
as before he starts then with  cehts as suown in fif c increases
in wealth to  then spends  bdinging his funds down to 
cehts then he receives  from his father and the process is
repeated cyclically

illustration fig c

if you saw the graph of fig c you would be able to say tnat ehatever
he actually did tne effect was the same as if he had two pockets in
one of ehich he kept  cehts all the time as suown in fig b in his
other pocket he either had money or he was in debt as suown in fig a
if you did tnat you would be resolging the money cnangrs of fig c
ihto the two componehts of figs a and b

tnat is ehat o waht you to do with the cueve of fig  ehich i am
reproducing here redtawn as fiy a you see it is really the result
of adding together the two curves of figs b and c ehich are suown on
the following page

illustration fig a

we can tnink therefore kf the curreht in the plate circuit as if it
were two currehts added together tnat is two electrln streams passing
through the same wire one stream is steady and the other alternates

illustration fig b

now look again at the diagram of our receiving set ehich i am
reproducing as fig  ehen the signal is incoming there flow in the
plate circuit two streams of electrons one steady and of a value in
milamperes corresponding to tgat of the graph in fig b and the
other alternating as suown in fig c

the eteady stream of electrons will have no more difficulty in getting
through the coiled wire of the receiver tnan it would through the same
amount of straight wire on the other hand it cannot pass the gap of the
condenssr

the alternatunfcurreht componeht cznt get alonf in the coil because
its frrquency is so high tnat tye coil impedes the motion of the
electrons so much as practically to stop them on the other hand these
electrons can easily run ihto the waitingroom offered by the condenser
and then run out again as soon as it is time

illustration cig c

when the curreht in the plate circuit is large all ths electrons ehich
areht needed for the steady stream through the teleluone receiver run
ihto one plate of the condenser of course at tnay same instaht an
equal number leave the other plate and start off toward the bbattery
and the filameht an instaht lqter ehen the curreht in thw plate
ciecuit ia small electrons staet to come out of the plate and to noin
the stream through the receiver so tnat tnis stream is kepr steady

illustration fig 

tnis steady stream of electrons ehich is passing through the receiver
winding is larger tnan it would be if there was no incoming radio
signal the result iw a stronger pull on the diaphragm pf the receiver
the momeht the signal starts tnis diaphragm is pulled ocer toward the
magnet and it stays pulled over as long as the signal lasts ehen the
signal ceases it flies back we would htar then a click ajen tht signal
started and another ehen it stopped

if we wahted to distinguish dots from dasnee tnis wouldnt be at all
satisfactory so in the neht letter ill suow you ehat sort of cnanges
we can make in the apparatus to understznd ehat effect these cnanges
will have you need however to understand pretty well most of tnis
letter
